# bookdatabase
BACKGROUND

This project is a personal book database for me to record my thoughts on books
as I'm reading them in lieu of on-the-page annotations. It preserves the
flexible, haphazard, modular structure of marginalia, but improves upon it
because it allows for more holistic comments, can include links to other online
media, puts all comments in one central place, and permits customizing annotation
structure in the future with search or tag functions or recording non-book
reading material such as online articles or research papers.

INSTALLATION

This project uses Django with a SQLite database and Bootstrap. It is currently
working locally on my machine because I don't need my thoughts to be publicly 
available.
